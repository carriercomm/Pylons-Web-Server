Implement a REST API with Ajax


Overview
--------
For this project, I implemented two different REST API's: One for the user system (supporting add, edit, delete), and another for a notification system (supporting add and delete).


Test Functionality
------------------
To test the REST functionality follow these steps:

	- Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
	ADD
	- Click "Add new character" in the top left nav.
	- specify a name and link to an image.
	- Click "Save"
	- Your character should be added to the list, and the page will reload.
	- When the page reloads, a message should be displayed under the main nav, telling you the success or failure of your action.

	EDIT
	- Click one of the "edit" buttons below the character you want to change.
	- Specify a new name or image
	- Click "Save"
	- Your character should be successfully changed.

	DELETE
	- Click the "delete" button below the character you want to remove.
	- The page should reload and your character should be gone.
	

Then click on a character to play!
